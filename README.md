# planck
The smallest (& worst) text editor ever. I wanted to make a really small text\
editor, inspired by kilo and uEmacs. I didn't plan for it to be any good, and I\
just kind of threw something together having fun.\

I did this with practically no idea what I was doing as well. I'm brand new to\
everything I did here, I was more used to game type stuff, using OpenGL, Qt,\
stuff like that. And this is also the first project I've "finished" (if you can\
call segfaulting on occasion "finished," but to fix that would require a com-\
plete rewrite.)

I learnt a lot, and really loved doing it. V2 sometime.

WARNING: Do not use this for anything serious. You WILL lose data. If you under-\
stand that this isn't a good piece of software, and want to fool around, go\
ahead. Do not blame me if something happens. Do not pull request or open issues,\
I will not be answering them. If you like the idea, fork the project.\
