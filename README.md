I wanted to make a text editor that was the smallest it could be before it stops
being a text editor. I didn't really plan for it to be any good, in fact if it
was terrible that would be sort of funny, but the level of garbage code that
this project has been unprecedented. It was fun, though. It's a project I've
finished. It's arguably functional. I really can't be assed to do anymore.

I also did this with absolutely no idea what I was doing. I used ptext for
reference and had a lot of bashing my head and made some stupid decisions. This
is quite literally the first project I have ever finished so far (if you can
call segfaulting on occasion "finished" but to fix that would require me to
completely restructure the program. so, v2 maybe, but v1 is finished) and it's
the first time I've ever done anything even remotely like this, I'm used to
GUI and graphics, calling OpenGL or GDI, and using Qt or Win32 in C++. This was
way out of what I do, being a C99 terminal text editor.

But I learnt a lot, and really loved doing it.

V2 sometime.

WARNING: PLEASE DON'T USE THIS--- YOU WILL LOSE DATA. IT WILL SEGFAULT. I CANNOT
BE ASSED TO FIX IT. DO NOT USE. DO NOT USE. DO NOT USE. Unless you understand
that it's broke and wanna use it for fun. In that case, go ahead. But don't
blame me if your computer blows up, or your data. Do not pull request or open
issues-- I will not be answering them. If you like the idea, just fork.
